/* The brook: the channel, the water in it, and where the basin drains to.
 *
 * This file exists because of a class of bug that is invisible in the code and
 * fatal in the render. The stream used to be authored twice — terrain.js cut a
 * groove of a fixed depth *below the surrounding ground*, and water.js laid a
 * surface at a fixed depth *below the trail's tread* — and the two references
 * are not the same surface. The trail is the lowest line across the corridor
 * by construction; the channel runs eight to sixteen metres out on the
 * shoulder, which is one to two and a half metres higher. So the water sat
 * that much below its own bed for nearly the whole of its length, was clipped
 * away by the depth test in the surface shader, and the level shipped with two
 * hundred metres of river that was submitted every frame and never drew a
 * pixel. The dry gully was still there, which is what made it look intentional.
 *
 * The fix is not a constant: it is to have one authority for the *water
 * surface* and derive both the bed and the mesh from it. Three properties are
 * enforced here and nowhere else:
 *
 *  1. It descends. A water surface that runs uphill is the one thing a stream
 *     may never do, and the ground it is lying on rolls by ±1.7 m at a
 *     wavelength of about fifty metres — far more than the 2 cm/m the valley
 *     itself falls. Taking a running minimum of the trail profile is what
 *     turns that roll into hydrology instead of into an error: where the
 *     ground rises the surface holds level and the channel simply cuts deeper,
 *     which is exactly what an incised stream does to a hump in its path.
 *
 *  2. It descends in *steps*. Quantising the profile to 22 cm and spending
 *     each drop over a short run gives a step-pool sequence — flat glides with
 *     a small fall between them — which is the form every small stream on a
 *     moderate grade takes. It is also the only cheap way to get white water:
 *     foam needs somewhere to be made, and a uniformly sloping ribbon has no
 *     such place.
 *
 *  3. It stays below the tread. The channel comes within four and a half
 *     metres of the path at its closest, and the walk to the falls must not
 *     ford anything.
 *
 * The bed is then the surface minus a depth, and terrain.js cuts *to* that bed
 * rather than subtracting from whatever was there. The channel is therefore
 * guaranteed to be a channel: the water cannot be above its banks and cannot
 * be under its floor, in either case regardless of what the height noise does.
 *
 * Nothing here imports three or the terrain. It is fed the trail geometry as
 * plain numbers so that the audio's offline renderer, which runs in Node, can
 * read the same centreline the render does.

 * It does not drain overland, and that is a fact about the terrain rather than
 * a decision. Measured cols out of the clearing, in metres above the pool's
 * surface: 1.3 due north, which is the trail and not available; 2.0
 * north-east, which is the brook's own gully and would have the outflow
 * running up the inflow; 2.5 to 4.2 everywhere else. The west rim, the obvious
 * place for a gutter, is solid masonry from x = -2 to x = -20 — the platform
 * the ruins put there — and trenching a channel under it would leave the
 * blocks standing on air.
 *
 * So the water leaves the way water leaves a closed basin in limestone, which
 * is what this whole cliff is made of: it goes down a swallow hole. A notch
 * cut through the rim at the south-east shoulder, a funnel of bare rock, and a
 * slot running away under an overhang. It costs three metres of terrain
 * instead of forty, it cannot conflict with anything already built, and it
 * puts the answer in the same frame as the question — from the causeway you
 * see the fall arriving on the left and the water going down the drain on the
 * right.
 *
 * The visible mechanics matter more than the hole: a drawdown dimple in the
 * surface, the flow field bending into it from half the basin, and the foam
 * the fall makes being carried round and swallowed. Without those it is a dark
 * patch at the water's edge; with them it is unmistakably where the water is
